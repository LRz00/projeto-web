    <h1>The David Cronenberg Archive</h1>  
   
    <!--ESPAÇO PARA A BIOGRAFIA DO AUTOR--> 
    <p>David Paul Cronenberg (born March 15, 1943) is a Canadian film director and screenwriter. 
        He is a principal originator of the body horror genre, with his films exploring visceral bodily transformation, 
        infectious diseases, and the intertwining of the psychological, physical, and technological. </p>
    <img src="imagens/david-cronenberg.jpg" alt="David Cronenberg - rosto">
   <p> <q>I think of horror films as art, as films of confrontations. Films that make you confront aspects of your own life that are difficult to face. Just because you're making a horror film doesn't mean you can't make an artful film.</q> - David Cronenberg</p>
